# bubbles
This is a social network that will try to solve the social problems that are caused by the current ones.

It is well known that the current social networks' algorithms mostly focus on getting you what you want or like in a very fast manner, which can lead people to isolate themselves in so-called social bubbles. 

They learn to live and deal only with people that they agree with or that have something in common with them, leading them to alienation and, of course, isolation. 

This social network, in a very simple manner, looks for a way to get out of the so-called bubbles by giving people a daily digest of what has been happening outside of their inner circles, or outside of their bubbles. Those digests would not be imposed into their experience, but they would greatly benefit from the social networkâ€™s model of open-mindfulness. 

This idea is under discussion and open for suggestions!
